# Wi-SUN border router configuration example

# Parsing rules:
#   - Everything after # is ignored
#   - Spaces are ignored
#   - Escape sequences \xXX (eg. \x20 for space, \x0A for new line) are accepted
#     in values.
#   - These characters are accepted (you have to use escaped sequences): SPACE,
#     '#', '\\', '\n' and '\r'

# Unless specified in the comment, commented settings are optional and the value
